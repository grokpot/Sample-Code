### Python
* [Calendar Emails](https://github.com/ryanprater/calendar_emails), 2014: A Python script to scrape emails from all Google Calendar events. Open sourced from an actual business application where we wanted to accumulate emails of everyone we've ever done business with.
* [Calendar Graph](https://github.com/ryanprater/calendar_graph), 2014: A Flask web app for visualizing my calendar appointments. Personal project where I experimented with Flask and Highcharts.js. [Screenshots and explanation here](https://ryanprater.com/blog/2014/10/20/calendar-graph-the-demo)

### Javascript
* [Screeps](https://github.com/ryanprater/screeps), 2017: Code for the game [Screeps](www.screeps.com). Initially I was introduced to game as a coding test for an employer, but found it so much fun that I kept developing.

### Java
* [Routy](https://github.com/ryanprater/Routy), 2012: an Android app for finding the most efficient route between multiple destinations (aka "Traveling Salesman"). Created in a university class with a couple good buddies.
