This is the MVC code for my personal blog at www.centeroftheinter.net (has not been publicly announced - still under construction)

Currently, I'm aware it's very basic and lacks bells, whistles, and CSS, but it's evidence of my ability to build Django apps.

As time goes by, I intend to update my blog and update this sample code. In the long run I'd like to make my configuration files private and make my blog repo public.
